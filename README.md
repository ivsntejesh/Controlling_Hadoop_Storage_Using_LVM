# Task-7
This is ARTH Task-7 repo 

This repo has the code for integrating LVM with hadoop cluster. Using LVM concept we can increase the size of the datanode on the fly without any distrubance to the present data in the node.

In this I have created a cluster with name node, data node, and client.

I have integrated LVM and Hadoop. 

The file set-up.py helps in configureing Name node, Data node, and Client. It aslo have code for AWS menu which helps in performing different tasks of AWS services.

I am also attaching file of install.py which helps in downloading hadoop into your system automatically.
